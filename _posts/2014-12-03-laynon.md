I have recently launched my updated blog site that has gone unmaintained over the last couple of years.  For awhile now, I have been interested in using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my blog.  GitHub Pages seems to be a great no cost high performance option for blogging.  It is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and I was intersted in finding a clean Jekyll theme for my site.  As a result, I decide to put in the time to update my site over the holidays and went searching the web.  I stumbled across an existing blog based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/).  I was happy to find that it was created and maintained by Mark Otto.

For years I have followed the work of [mdo](https://github.com/mdo).  He is one of the primary authors of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) the wildly popular CSS framework.  He has recently been working on a new project [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) for easily building Jekyll sites.  It has two official themes Hyde and Lanyon.  

In this article I outline some of the improvements I made to Lanyon when making this site.  Since the Lanyon theme is pretty new, I thought others might be intersted in finding ways to improving it as well.

## Getting Started

I duplicated the repo into my person nnance.github.io repo
```
git clone --bare https://github.com/poole/lanyon.git
cd lanyon.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/nnance/nnance.github.io.git
rm -rf lanyon.git
```

Once you have the latest version of Lanyon you will need to update the _config.yml and create a CNAME file.  The details of this can be found on the Poole website.

## Adding A Commenting System

I wanted to have a commenting system and have always found the [Disqus](http://disqus.com) service a super easy way to integrate commenting into any blog system.   Once you have created a Disqus account it will provide you with a basic block HTML you can insert into your site.  To include it in Lanyon I added the following block to the end of the file

### _layouts/post.html
```
{% if page.comments %}
# Disqus block
{% endif %}
```
Now if you simply add comments: true to a Post Front Matter block you will have an imbedded comment system.

## Using Excerpt in Index

By default, Lanyon provides a list of the last 3 posts that contains the complete content of each post.  I decided I preferred my main page to include just excerpts from my blog posts with links to the complete post.  I I changed index.html to use post.excerpt instead of post.content.  Because I wanted to have an image and the first paragraph as part of each excerpt I had to use a custom excerpt separator.  This can be accomplished by

### _config.yml
```
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
```

Then add the <!--more--> block at each point in your post where you want the excerpt to stop.  Make sure you have line breaks before and after the excerpt block.
